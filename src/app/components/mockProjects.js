Bullpen lives where crypto actually happens — in Telegram threads, X replies, and unhinged trading channels. As the social-first platform for multiplayer trading, Bullpen makes it effortlessly fun to follow smart money and stay ahead of the market. We teamed up with the Bullpen team to rebrand and update their digital presence.

When they came to us, the product was smart but the brand energy was… off. It felt overly masculine, visually uninspired, and even a bit scammy. Bullpen isn’t for hedge fund suits or DeFi purists. It’s for the 2 a.m. trade warriors making high-risk moves from a cracked iPhone with six tabs open. Their world is chaotic, irreverent, and full of memes, inside jokes, sarcasm, and extreme mood swings. We saw an opportunity to build a brand that speaks their language rather than sanitizing it.

The culture was already writing the brand. It was in the chat threads: the oddball usernames, the hyper-online spellings, the old-school emoticons, the rollercoaster of moods. We turned those into design elements, using the chat bubble as a visual motif. Inside the bubbles, we mirrored the emotional whiplash of trading, from manic glee to full existential meltdown, often within minutes.

The old logomark was an overly-detailed bull’s head, making it clunky and hard to read at the size of tiny Telegram avatars and low-res screenshots. We stripped it down to just the forward-leaning horns. It reads fast, even when it’s small, and signals movement. It still says “bull,” but in a way that you can grab onto without overthinking it.

The typeface, ABC Favorit, does a lot of heavy lifting. High x-height, tight spacing, solid personality. It’s built for interfaces but doesn’t feel cold. We pushed it to heavier weights to give the brand more punch, without tipping into tech-bro territory. The color palette went the opposite direction. We kept it minimal: a punchy bluish-green, a near-black offshoot, and a pale, almost-white tint of the same. Tight and controlled. Strong enough to carry the brand, quiet enough to let the content breathe. An extended set supports the product UI without muddying the brand core.

Yeah, we added a mascot, a slightly ridiculous yet likable cartoon bull. It’s a nod to the weirdness of the space. It’s just fun. Bullpen is serious about what it does, but not so serious that it can’t laugh at itself. To round out the system, we designed a sticker set full of crypto-flavored references — “gm”s, arrows, buy buttons, all of it. They bring extra expression into chat threads, social posts, and user comms. Because half of the brand is context, and Bullpen’s context is extremely online.

All in all, the new Bullpen brand shows up like a native. It matches the energy of the people who actually use it. It’s not cleaned up, dumbed down, or corporate-safe. It’s just here for a good, smart time — and ready to ride the next market swing, wherever it goes.`, // gekürzt zur Übersichtlichkeit
